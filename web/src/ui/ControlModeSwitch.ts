/**
 * Manual override for the keyboard-legend-vs-touch-controls auto-detect
 * (see the `(pointer: coarse) and (not (any-pointer: fine))` media query
 * in style.css). That heuristic gets it wrong on real hardware in ways
 * that aren't fixable in CSS alone — a touchscreen-equipped desktop that
 * still wants the keyboard legend, or a Kindle Fire whose Fire OS build
 * reportedly changes what it reports for pointer capability between
 * portrait and landscape orientation (with a detachable keyboard case),
 * leaving it stuck on the keyboard legend in portrait despite being a
 * touch-only device there. The two `.control-mode-switch` buttons (one
 * embedded in each panel, so whichever panel is currently showing offers
 * a way to switch to the other) let the player just pick, and the choice
 * is remembered per-browser via localStorage so it doesn't need
 * re-picking every load.
